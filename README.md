# nomad.

## Project Overview
nomad. is a gamified wellness and exploration app. It turns the city into an interactive map where users explore real locations, learn local history through NPCs, complete AI-generated challenges, and unlock rewardsfrom our shop, or from local businesses.

#### Core goals:
- Encourage intentional movement and exploration
- Help users appreciate local history and culture
- Support local businesses through ethical, location-based rewards
- Promote wellness without intense pressure, but with fun incentives
